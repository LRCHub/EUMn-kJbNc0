As I was thinking back*
Back to a day,
Where it was mid-day,
But the sky was black like midnight.
Seeing a lifeless body impaled by nails
Suffering at the blast of hell,
Caught my attention cause it looked like a blood bath as I
Looked past and saw a broken man
Soaked in the white hot wrath of God and I asked why.
I found some answers in His bloody face.
A face I began to recognize in the background of every instance of my life, I ignored.
Suddenly sense these spirits flooding, soothing my rude, rude soul.
Though ruined by the world's view,
He wooed me,
Though crude and without a clue and screwed up out of my mind
He pursued me 'til He made me holy.
Whole.
