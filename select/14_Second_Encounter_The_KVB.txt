Yeah you're right it's like before,
The curtain fell, but they wanted more

Your body's weak, it's slipping away,
Get off the floor, there's no time to waste

So here you go, a shot in the dark, you wanted it then, you got it now
Look through the hole, see the other side,
The mirrors cracked, but is it your mind

The hours move, with twisted hands,
Bury your head, forget your plans today
