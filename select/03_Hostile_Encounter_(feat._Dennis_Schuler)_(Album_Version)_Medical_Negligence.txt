Don't expect a friendly meeting
You will live the meaning of grief
It's time to pay your debts
Those ones that made me insane
I was waiting for this day
When my dreams come to life
There you are, piece of shit
You deserve a gruesome end

Numbed with chloroform I put you
inside of my van
Tying your limbs and stripping you before
I start to use my tools
I've never loved justice before
Until I saw you so fucking helpless
You own the sentence that
I will write with a knife in your torso
I fucking write your sentence
With a knife I wrote your sentence

Grabbing your tongue with my tweezers as you wake up
Waiting for you to feel how I rip it off
Tormenting you is satisfying
I want to do it day by day

I'm hostile
I'm hostile
I'm hostile
I'm hostile
Rest in piss
